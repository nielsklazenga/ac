Pandoc conversion from HTML to Markdown

1. At the Windows command prompt, change the default code page (character encoding) to UTF-8 by:
chcp 65001
Note: The Pandoc documentation says that input and output can be piped through iconv when the local character encoding isn not UTF-8, but I think this solution is simpler.

2. To avoid path issues, navigate to the directory containing the file to be converted.  Alternatively, HTML can be fetched directly from the web using HTTP, for example:
pandoc -f html -t markdown http://www.fsf.org

3. Pandoc can guess the desired format from the file extension.  However, its default Markdown is embelished with Pandoc ideosyncracies that don't render at Github. To get strict Markdown, use the
-f markdown_strict .  One can also try -f gfm (for GitHub-Flavored Markdown).

4. Relevant options are:
-o (output to file)
-f (from; input format)
-t (to; output format)


The input file (or URL) is listed at the end of the command

5. Here is an example:
pandoc -f html -t gfm -o structure.md https://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/Audubon_Core_Structure
